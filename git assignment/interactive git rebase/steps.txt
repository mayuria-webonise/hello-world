1) In my local machine I have downloaded the hello-world repository
2) In it created new branch named new
3) now modified some files with new branch and added one commit for each modification
4) now to demonastrate interactive rebase i have used interactive rebase with last 3 commits
5) git rebase -i HEAD~3
6) now as editor appears i have dropped one commit
7) I have also squashed 2 commits
